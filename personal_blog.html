<h1>নমস্কার I'M ABHISHEK BASU</h1>

<p>
নমস্কার (Nomoskar) is a greeting in my native language Bengali. I'm Abhishek Basu. This page presents a gist of my academic journey.

​​<h4>Academic background​​</h4>
Infrastructure of a region impacts the standard of living and is an important parameter that marks the level of progress in a society. India is on the verge of becoming a developed nation and the time is ripe for tremendous development in the infrastructure. This motivated me to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

As an undergraduate I had a particular interest in Transportation Engineering. In my junior year, I was introduced to transportation engineering through core courses, where I learnt geometric design of roads, pavement design and basic transportation planning. I did multiple projects, one of which involved the redesign of campus roads using Bentley MX Roads software suite, so that design violations could be identified and subsequently rectified. This project was implemented by the Engineering Unit of IIT.

Post completion of the core courses, I chose multiple electives in this domain. The course “Transportation Network Analysis” helped me to develop a strong background in data structures and network algorithms. The course project involved analyzing effect of signal delays on shortest path algorithm. For this an algorithm was devised and implemented in C language and tested on Chennai network data. The course “Analytical Techniques in Transportation” helped me to appreciate policy decision-making backed by statistical techniques. As a part of the course project, my team performed regression analysis on a dataset that consisted of flow data at an intersection. The project involved performing descriptive statistics, specifying the model, estimating the coefficients and validation. It was done using R statistical software.
​
After my junior year, I interned in the highways division of L&amp;T Infrastructure Development Projects Limited. Here my task was to design a section of National Highway 9 in AutoCAD Civil 3D. I also worked on predicting traffic on a State Highway that was under construction and observed the bidding process employed by infrastructure firms and the way contractual agreements are defined.
​
In my senior year, I chose two electives in this field. The course titled “Urban Transportation Planning” helped me understand the transportation planning process. As part of the course project, I applied the four-step planning process on a real-world dataset. The course “Computer Applications in Highway &amp; Traffic Engineering” taught me to simulate traffic flow, through code and by using software such as Vissim. It also taught me data analysis techniques used commonly in transportation domain.

<h4>Paper publication and presentation</h4>
For my undergraduate thesis, I developed a route planner for city bus service. Real-time GPS feed from buses was used as input and Genetic Algorithm was chosen to compute the ideal route. I coded and implemented the planner and eventually created a mobile application for the same. The experience helped me explore the realm of genetic algorithms and additionally called for innovative programming techniques to be used during implementation, so that the route planner could be fast, robust and scalable.

The methodology and findings of my thesis were condensed into a paper and the same has been selected for presentation at the Transportation Research Board 2016 Annual Meeting and is under re-review for inclusion in Transportation Research Record.

​I concurrently worked with a PhD scholar on analysis of level of safety of multi-lane rural highway under heterogeneous traffic condition. The findings were condensed into a paper and has been selected for presentation at the Transportation Research Board 2016 Annual Meeting.

<h4>Scholarships</h4>
I secured the prestigious O.P. Jindal Engineering and Management Scholarship for academic and leadership excellence in 2014. I was also a finalist in the prestigious Stanford Dirubhai Fellowship, where in my essay, I advocated the need to adopt smart transportation systems and the fact that it was a pressing need that could no longer be ignored as it affected the society as a whole.

I have consistently scored straight A’s in majority of my courses and eventually finished school at the top of my batch, winning the institute medal (Larsen &amp; Toubro ECC Endowment Prize) for best academic record in Civil Engineering,

<h4>Extra-curricular activities</h4>
I participated in, and won several technical, cultural and literary competitions. My team finished 11th out of 600+ teams in Shell Ideas 360, where we developed a solar bubble pump that achieved remarkable efficiency and was considerably cheap to construct as compared to traditional solar pumps. I have also been part of the autonomous robotics team and secured 2nd prize in Goldrush, an intra-collegiate robotics competition. I participated in “Microsoft code.fun.do” where my team developed a  mobile application for event planning based on network algorithm.

Being elected as the Literary Secretary of my hostel in my junior year, I led the hostel in events such as creative writing, dramatics and short film making, bagging 2nd prize at intra-college competition. I was also responsible for organizing the institute’s first ever film festival during the annual cultural festival. I also won the 3rd prize at inter-college debate competition and served as the lead editor of “Contour” the annual departmental magazine. I was also part of the choir that performed during the 49th convocation IIT Madras.

In my senior year, I was elected as the Secretary of Civil Engineering Association, IIT Madras and governed a body of about 900 students. We helped organize a plethora of activities such as model building, CAD competitions, debates, etc. throughout the year aimed at Civil Engineering students. 

I support social causes targeting education. As a part of NGO Pravinya, I developed multimedia rich educational content for high school students. I have always supported the cause of computer literacy across schools and hence volunteered as a part of large scale computer renovation project for government run schools in Chennai. As part of a three-member team, I developed a prototype for a low-cost computing package targeting underprivileged children. This was funded through IIT Madras alumni under the “NIRMAAN” scheme.

<h4>Current job</h4>
Post graduation, I began work as a Consultant in the Data Analytics division in Inductis (EXL Service) and my role involves using statistics and machine learning in decision making to improve and optimise chosen parameters for clients from a wide range of industries, including (but not restricted to) insurance and travel &amp; logistics. I use a plethora of statistical software and Python programming language with open source libraries geared towards data analysis. The work is immensely satisfying since it involves skills I learnt through my undergraduate coursework and while I was working on my thesis.

<h4>Future aspirations​​</h4>
I wish to pursue my graduate and doctoral studies in the field of Transportation Engineering and my aim is to create a significant impact in the transportation industry in the years to come. Thereafter, my aim is to pursue an academic career and concurrently work as an independent consultant for government transportation projects. My résumé is available here.
